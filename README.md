- 👋 Hi, I’m @KMFBlue
- 👀 I’m interested in learning programming.
- 🌱 I’m currently online attending The complete 2022 Web Development Bootcamp bycAngela Yu.
- I'm also designing web page for my small taxi business in Zagreb, Croatia. It's mainly for tourists who come in 
- summer to explore Croatia. I finished HTML, CSS and I'm half way through JS presently. You can take a look at my 
- work here.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on HTML, CSS, JS at the moment.
